Machine Learning Internship Tasks

This repository contains my internship tasks in the domain of Machine Learning.
Each task demonstrates the application of fundamental ML concepts using Python.
Task 01: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
-> Problem Statement:
Implement a Linear Regression model to predict the prices of houses based on:

Square footage

Number of bedrooms

Number of bathrooms

ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is a House Price Dataset (provided during the internship).
It includes features like house size, bedrooms, bathrooms, and corresponding prices.
-> Requirements:

Install dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

requirements.txt should include (you can add more if used):
numpy  
pandas  
matplotlib  
scikit-learn
How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<username>/SCT_ML_1.git
cd SCT_ML_1


Run the script:

python task1_linear_regression.py
-> Output

Trains a Linear Regression model.

Evaluates performance with metrics (e.g., RÂ² score, Mean Squared Error).

Provides predictions and visualizations of actual vs. predicted house prices.
